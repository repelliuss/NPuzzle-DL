&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*NPuzzle ML* is developed for Android environment. It also contains an AI to help user to solve puzzle. Deep learning techniques used to train AI with recurrent neural networks and LSTM. Currently, models give around %62 accurate on average for all board sizes (3x3, 3x4, ..., 9x8, 9x9). They are capable to solve light complex boards themselves but should be better for more complex situations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*NPuzzle ML* written in Java and Python, utilized Tensorflow and Jupyter Notebook.
